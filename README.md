# RDBMS-Project_USMuseum-Analysis
As a museum lover, I always acquire lots of knowledge from them. But sometimes I can’t help but wonder, students usually have discounts for some particular museums, and the everyone’s visiting frequency for one specific museum is not that high, so...do they really earn enough money to operate?
So the Business problem space I wanna explore is “How’s museum’s financial condition in the US? What kind of museums earn the most?”

## Data source:
I found a dataset on Kaggle, regarding Name, location, and revenue for every museum in the United States It contains basic information of the museum like Museums’ name, museum types location, phone number as well as what I need– its Income, Revenue (some financial related data)
The basic information contained in the dataset is quite detailed. It includes state, city, county and address, so that I can classify, or group by the data I need, Or to examine museums’ financial condition with different aspects in my following steps.
